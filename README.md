Personal note: "" touch README.md "" is not good enough. Add the README.md through github for now.

This is a list of my favorite foods and how to cook them. While I have never made these specific dishes myself, the recipes seem close enough to what I'm used to preparing without giving away my own recipe. Enjoy!
